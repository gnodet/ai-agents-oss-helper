# AI Agents OSS Helper

A skill for AI coding agents (Claude, Bob, Gemini, OpenCode, Codex) that provides guidelines for contributing to open source projects. The skill auto-detects the current project via `git remote get-url origin` and loads project-specific configuration from rule files.

For agents that support skills natively (Claude, Bob, Codex), the helper is installed as background knowledge — just describe what you want to do and the agent follows the appropriate guidelines automatically. For other agents (Gemini, OpenCode), individual commands are generated from the same guidelines.

## Getting Started

Any project can use the helper by adding an `.oss-ai-helper-rules/` directory to its repository root with three rule files:

```
my-project/
├── .oss-ai-helper-rules/
│   ├── project-info.md          # Repository URLs, issue trackers, related repos
│   ├── project-standards.md     # Build tools, commands, code style restrictions
│   └── project-guidelines.md    # Branch naming, commit formats, PR policies
└── ...
```

Use the Add Project guideline to generate initial rule files for any project. Once committed, every contributor gets the right configuration automatically — no per-user installation of project-specific rules required.

## Installation

### Quick Install (All Agents)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Open-Harness-Engineering/ai-agents-oss-helper/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Selective Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Open-Harness-Engineering/ai-agents-oss-helper.git
cd ai-agents-oss-helper

# Install for specific agent
./install.sh claude    # Claude only
./install.sh bob       # Bob only
./install.sh gemini    # Gemini CLI only
./install.sh opencode  # OpenCode only
./install.sh codex     # Codex only
./install.sh           # All agents
```

## How It Works

The helper provides guidelines that are project-agnostic. Project-specific configuration is stored in rule files with three files per project:
- **`project-info.md`** - Repository URLs, issue trackers, SonarCloud keys, related repos
- **`project-standards.md`** - Build tools, commands, code style restrictions
- **`project-guidelines.md`** - Branch naming, commit formats, PR policies, task labels

### Rule loading priority

The skill initializes by loading project rules in this priority order:

1. **Project-local rules** - `.oss-ai-helper-rules/` directory in the repository root. Highest priority, versioned with the project.
2. **Installed fallback rules** - A subdirectory under the agent's local rules directory (for example `~/.claude/rules/<project>/`) whose `project-info.md` declares a matching `Remote pattern`. Install these on demand with the Install Info guideline.
3. **Auto-discovery** - If no rules exist anywhere, the agent auto-discovers the project's configuration (build tool, conventions, etc.) and generates rule files in `.oss-ai-helper-rules/` so they can be committed and shared.

Projects should adopt project-local rules so that configuration travels with the repository and stays in sync across all contributors and agents.

### Where the rules come from

Project rules are not bundled with the installer. They live in a separate repository, [`Open-Harness-Engineering/ai-agents-oss-known-projects`](https://github.com/Open-Harness-Engineering/ai-agents-oss-known-projects), and are installed on demand via the Install Info guideline. This keeps the helper focused on guidelines and lets projects that prefer not to host AI-agent metadata in their source tree have rules hosted centrally instead.

## Capabilities

The OSS Helper provides guidelines for the following tasks. For agents with skill support (Claude, Bob, Codex), just describe what you want in natural language. For other agents, use the corresponding command.

## Usage Examples

### Fix an Issue

```
# With Claude, Bob, or Codex — just ask naturally:
fix issue 42
fix issue CAMEL-20410
fix https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/issues/42

# With Gemini or OpenCode — use the command:
/oss-fix-issue 42
/oss-fix-issue CAMEL-20410
```

### Find a Task

```
# Natural language:
find me a task to contribute to

# Command:
/oss-find-task
```

### Review a Pull Request

```
# Natural language:
review PR 42
review https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku/pull/42

# Command:
/oss-review-pr 42
```

### Quick Fix

```
# Natural language:
upgrade Quarkus BOM to 3.18.0
fix broken link in CONTRIBUTING.md

# Command:
/oss-quick-fix upgrade Quarkus BOM to 3.18.0
```

### Backport a Merged PR

```
# Natural language:
backport PR 42 to the release/1.x branch

# Command:
/oss-backport-pr 42 branch=release/1.x
```

### Install Project Rules

```
# Natural language:
install project rules for camel-core

# Command:
/oss-install-info camel-core
/oss-install-info auto           # detect from git remote
/oss-install-info all            # install all known projects
```

#### Pointing at a different rules repository

The default source is [`Open-Harness-Engineering/ai-agents-oss-known-projects`](https://github.com/Open-Harness-Engineering/ai-agents-oss-known-projects) on the `main` branch. You can override either part with environment variables — useful for teams that maintain a private fork of the rules repo:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OSS_KNOWN_PROJECTS_REPO` | `Open-Harness-Engineering/ai-agents-oss-known-projects` | GitHub `org/repo` to read rules from |
| `OSS_KNOWN_PROJECTS_BRANCH` | `main` | Branch within that repository |

## Agent-Specific Notes

### Claude, Bob

Installed as a single background skill at `~/.{agent}/skills/oss-helper/`. The agent auto-loads the skill when your request matches its capabilities — no explicit command invocation needed.

### Gemini CLI

Individual TOML commands are generated from each guideline file and installed to `~/.gemini/commands/`. Each command includes a preamble instructing Gemini to read project rules from `~/.gemini/rules/<project-directory>/`.

### OpenCode

Individual markdown commands with frontmatter are generated and installed to `~/.config/opencode/commands/`. Each command includes a preamble for project rule loading from `~/.config/opencode/rules/<project-directory>/`.

### Codex

Installed as a single skill directory at `~/.agents/skills/oss-helper/` with all guideline files as supporting files. Project rule files are installed to `~/.codex/oss-helper/rules/`.
